# Playlist
Playlist is a easy way to keep the songs you love organized. You can add, edit and delete the songs from your playlist as you wish.

## Getting Started

Start by signing in to your account or registering if you haven't signed up.

password: 12345Prince
```

Once you are signed in, you can check out some of the playlists made by the Playlist staff or create your own. You will need a playlist name and image to get started.

After you submit a playlist image, click on your playlist image and you can start to add songs to your new playlist.

If you make a mistake while adding your songs, you can just click on the song and then click edit.

If you decide you need to delete the whole playlist, you can just click delete playlist at the top left corner of the page.
```
Delete playlist
```

## Deployment
I used Heroku to deploy my application. You can view it live at ![Playlist](https://playlist-deploy.herokuapp.com)

## Updates
It seems silly to have a playlist that doesn't play music. I would like to add music to the application so that when you click on a song, you can listen to that song.
